<h1>Netizen</h1>
<p>There was a time when the internet was a city out of sight. A place you couldn't travel to.<p>
A city built by hand; each with a corner that  belonged to themself.<p>
<br>
<p>Their obsessions spilled through the screen. From the band they loved, the conspiracy they half believed, the poetry they wrote at 3am.<br>
All under a pseudonym that felt more real than their legal name.<p>
<br>  
<p>There was a charm to the chaos. Often fragments of one's consiousness. Strange but sincere.<p>
<br>  
<p>The internet used to be a place. Where being online meant being somewhere, instead of on something.</p>
